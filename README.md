Project: Responsive Webpage, Real-time Chat Application, and AWS Lambda Functions
This project showcases a combination of frontend development, a Django-based real-time chat application, and AWS Lambda functions. It is designed to demonstrate skills in responsive web design, backend development, WebSocket integration, and serverless computing.

1)Frontend Development
Responsive Webpage Features:

Fixed Navbar: Static top navigation bar remains visible during scrolling.

Layout: Includes a collapsible left menu, a main content area, and a right-side panel.

Footer: Fixed footer at the bottom of the page.

  700px to 767px: Shrinks to 80%.
  
  600px to 700px: Shrinks to 75%.
  
  â‰¤600px: Shrinks to 50%.

Running the Frontend:
